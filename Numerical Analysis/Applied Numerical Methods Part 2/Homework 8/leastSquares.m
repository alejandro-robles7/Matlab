%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This matlab function leastSquares finds the squares polynomial of degree n% 
% Input: %
% x: vector of xi's %
% y: vector of yi's %
% n: degree of polynomial %
% Output: %
% a: vector of [a0 , a1, ..., an] solving Pn(x) = anxn + an?1xn?1 + иии + a1x + a0 %
% e = Error term %
% Also graphs the data %
